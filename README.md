# Go Redis  (Work in Progress)

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Redis-like server in Go. Please note that this project is a work in progress, and there is still much work to be done to make it a fully functional Redis server. This README provides an overview of the project and summarizes what has been learned from the existing code.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a Redis server using the Go programming language ( for learning ). Redis is a popular in-memory data store that supports various data structures and is known for its speed and simplicity. This implementation aims to mimic some of the basic functionality of Redis, such as handling commands and storing data in-memory. 

## Current Status

As of the latest commit, the project has the following features and limitations:

- Basic TCP server functionality: The project sets up a TCP server that listens on port 6379, which is the default port for Redis.

- AOF (Append-Only File): The project initializes an Append-Only File (AOF) to persist data between server restarts. The AOF is read during server startup.

- Handling Single Requests: The server can handle single requests from clients, such as parsing Redis RESP protocol commands and generating responses.

- Handling Connections Concurrently: The code has been updated to handle multiple client connections concurrently using goroutines, allowing it to process requests from multiple clients simultaneously.

- Incomplete Redis Functionality: The project currently lacks many of the advanced features and data structures found in a full-fledged Redis server. It serves as a basic starting point for further development.

## What We've Learned

From working on the project, we've learned the following:

1. **Networking in Go:** The code demonstrates how to set up a simple TCP server using Go's `net` package. It listens for incoming connections and handles them concurrently using goroutines.

2. **Concurrency with Goroutines:** The code showcases the use of goroutines to handle multiple client connections concurrently. Each client connection is processed independently, allowing for parallel execution.

3. **Parsing RESP Protocol:** The code includes parsing logic for the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP), which is the wire protocol used by Redis for communication with clients.

4. **AOF Implementation:** The code initializes and reads from an Append-Only File (AOF) for data persistence, ensuring that data survives server restarts.

## Next Steps

The project is a foundation for building a more feature-rich Redis server. Here are some potential next steps and areas for improvement:

- Implement Redis Commands: Add support for a wider range of Redis commands and data structures to make the server more functional.

- Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide meaningful error messages and improve server reliability.

- Data Storage: Explore different data storage strategies, such as in-memory data structures or more efficient data persistence methods.

- Performance Optimization: Optimize server performance for handling a large number of concurrent clients and processing commands efficiently.

- Testing: Develop comprehensive test suites to ensure the correctness and reliability of the server.

- Documentation: Provide clear and detailed documentation for users and contributors to understand the project and its codebase.
